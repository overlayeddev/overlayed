## 🤔 TL;DR

Is it safe? Yes, Overlayed is safe to download and use. Overlayed has to build trust with Microsoft so this banner will not go away until that point is reached.

SmartScreen is the blue popup that you may see when trying to install Overlayed on Windows.

protects against phishing or malware websites and applications, and the
downloading of potentially malicious files.

Overlayed signs its windows executables (.msi and .exe) with a code signing certificate from <Link to="https://ssl.com">ssl.com</Link> in order to build trust with Microsoft. However, since Overlayed uses an <Link to="https://www.ssl.com/faqs/which-code-signing-certificate-do-i-need-ev-ov/">OV Code Signing certificate</Link> it again means trust has to be built over time.
