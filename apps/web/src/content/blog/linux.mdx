## ⬇️ Installing

On Linux, Overlayed is packaged as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org). This means that you are not required to install the app, but can just run it. There are two primary methods how you can run AppImages.

### Graphical Method

Open your preferred file explorer and browse to the location where you downloaded `Overlayed_x.x.x.AppImage`.

Right click the file and click the 'Properties' entry.

The window might look something like this:

In this window, check the 'Executable as Program' option.
Once you are done, you can close the window and double click the file to run Overlayed.

### Terminal Method

1. Navigate to the location where you have downloaded Overlayed using `cd <your location here>`.
2. Mark the file as an executable: `chmod +x Overlayed_x.x.x.AppImage`
3. Now you can run Overlayed using `./Overlayed_x.x.x.AppImage`

### Installation using AppImageLauncher

If you want to install Overlayed similar to your other apps, you can use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to allow simple installations using a double click on the app.

You can follow [the instructions here](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher/wiki) to install AppImageLauncher, and then install Overlayed by just double clicking the file and following the instructions.

## 🥳 Congratulations!

You now have Overlayed and you can follow the steps provided in the app to get started!
